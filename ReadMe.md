# THIS IS OUTDATED AND NEED A LOT OF REFACTORING AND REWORKING BECAUSE I CREATED THIS PROJECT 3 YEARS AGO FOR MY CS COURSE. AND AT THAT TIME I WAS A NOOB.


We use SDL2 to make this project: http://www.libsdl.org/

NOTE2: 
When running program
* The text box is next to Load button
* If you want to input item of Node by textbox, first click left-mouse button on the textbox to write then click right-mouse button to finish the input.
* If you want to insert before Node, first click on wanted node and then click the Insert BF button.
* The Ch. Mode button changes the modes (Step-By-Step mode or Normal Mode)
* In Step-By-Step Mode, once you click the button it does only one step and effect (the yellow/red circle etc), you must click it many times to finish the action.
* Traversed Circle in Step-By-Step mode moved by left/right arrow.

That all. GLHF :)
