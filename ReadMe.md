## THIS IS OUTDATED AND NEED A LOT OF REFACTORING AND REWORKING BECAUSE I CREATED THIS PROJECT 3 YEARS AGO FOR MY CS COURSE.
## AND AT THAT TIME I WAS A NOOB.


We use SDL2 to make this project: http://www.libsdl.org/

Install Tutorial: http://www.lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php
Extension Librabry (TTF and image needed): http://www.lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/index.php
Compiled by command line (src): g++ *.cpp -w -std=c++11 -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -o main

NOTE: Change include header appropriate to your OS and IDE. (read the following links for more infomation)
NOTE2: 
When running program
    + The text box is next to Load button
    + If you want to input item of Node by textbox, first click left-mouse button on the textbox to write then click right-mouse button to finish the input.
    + If you want to insert before Node, first click on wanted node and then click the Insert BF button.
    + The Ch. Mode button changes the modes (Step-By-Step mode or Normal Mode)
    + In Step-By-Step Mode, once you click the button it does only one step and effect (the yellow/red circle etc), you must click it many times to finish the action.
    + Traversed Circle in Step-By-Step mode moved by left/right arrow.
NOTE3: The application file in the src folder.

That all. GLHF :)
